# Diesel-Heater-Mount-Template
Use this project to accurately center punch your van before drilling.
Print heaterMount.stl and make sure you can fit the template on to your heater. It should be a tight fit.
Print the heaterMount_PUNCH.stl and tape it securely where you want the heater to mount. Center punch through the template into the mounting area.
Pay attention to the markings UP and DOWN. UP and DOWN assume you are mounting to the top of a floor with the heater intake and exhaust point down through the floor.
